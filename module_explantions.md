The `if __name__ == "__main__":` line is a common Python idiom for making sure the code that follows it only gets executed when the script is run directly, and not when it's imported as a module into another script. Here's how it works:

1. **Script Execution**: When you run a Python script, Python sets the special variable `__name__` to `"__main__"` in that script's namespace.

2. **Module Import**: On the other hand, if you were to import this script as a module in another script, the `__name__` variable would be set to the name of the script/module, not `"__main__"`.

3. **Conditional Execution**: The `if __name__ == "__main__":` check allows the script to have parts that both can be imported and used in other scripts, as well as parts that only execute when the script itself is run.

4. **Code Isolation**: This idiom is often used to write code that can be both reusable (as a module) and runnable as a standalone script. This makes testing easier and allows the same code to be used in different contexts without alteration.

### Solution

In the context of your code, the line `if __name__ == "__main__":` ensures that the main loop for data fetching and the user input prompt only execute when the script is run directly. If you were to import this script into another Python file, that block of code under this condition would not execute, making the functions and other definitions available for use in the importing script without executing the main logic.
