Section A: playerStatistics table and the Foreign Key (FK) Relationships

1. Very important schema information
playerStatistics table is based on the ESPN NFL athlete statstics imported from the ESPN API
playerStatistics is used to build all of the foreign key relationships in the database

2. Very Important Foreign Key Relationships
playerStatistics.playerStatusFK = athleteStatus.id
playerStatistics.playerFK = athletes.id
playerStatistics.leagueFK = league.id
playerStatistics.PlayerPositionFK = positions.id
playerStatistics.seasonFK = season.id
playerStatistics.playerTeamFK = teams.id

Section B: Match 'week' column in playerStatistics and the corresponding week for the betting line tables
1. Get the available weeks and correct current season (year) from the playerStatistics table.
/*sqlite3 query*/
SELECT DISTINCT week
FROM playerStatistics
WHERE weekStart LIKE('%2023%')
ORDER BY week;

2. Choose a week from the playerStatistics table based on the available weeks and the current season (year).
/*sqlite3 query*/
SELECT weekStart, weekEnd, week
FROM playerStatistics
WHERE week LIKE('week 6') AND
weekStart LIKE('%2023%')

Section C: FantasyPros Table foreign key relationships
1. The FantasyPros tables are as follows:
fantasy_pros_Def
fantasy_pros_K
fantasy_pros_QB
fantasy_pros_RB
fantasy_pros_TE
fantasy_pros_WR

2. FantasyPros Tables Foreign Key Relationships
fantasy_pros_Def.team_id = teams.id 

fantasy_pros_K.player_id = athletes.id
fantasy_pros_K.position_id = positions.id
fantasy_pros_K.team_id = teams.id

fantasy_pros_QB.player_id = athletes.id  
fantasy_pros_QB.position_id = positions.id  
fantasy_pros_QB.team_id = teams.id  

fantasy_pros_RB.player_id = athletes.id  
fantasy_pros_RB.position_id = positions.id  
fantasy_pros_RB.team_id = teams.id  

fantasy_pros_QB.player_id = athletes.id   
fantasy_pros_QB.position_id = positions.id   
fantasy_pros_QB.team_id = teams.id   

fantasy_pros_TE.player_id = athletes.id   
fantasy_pros_TE.position_id = positions.id   
fantasy_pros_TE.team_id = teams.id   

fantasy_pros_WR.player_id = athletes.id   
fantasy_pros_WR.position_id = positions.id   
fantasy_pros_WR.team_id = teams.id   

3. Obtain the available weeks for the FantasyPros tables

/*sqlite3 query available weeks for FantasyPros Defense (Def) position*/
SELECT DISTINCT week
FROM fantasy_pros_Def
WHERE season LIKE = 2023
ORDER by week ASC

/*sqlite3 query available weeks for FantasyPros Kicker (K) position*/
SELECT DISTINCT week
FROM fantasy_pros_K
WHERE season LIKE = 2023
ORDER by week ASC

/*sqlite3 query available weeks for FantasyPros Quarterback (QB) position*/
SELECT DISTINCT week
FROM fantasy_pros_QB
WHERE season LIKE = 2023
ORDER by week ASC

/*sqlite3 query available weeks for FantasyPros Runningback (RB) position*/
SELECT DISTINCT week
FROM fantasy_pros_RB
WHERE season LIKE = 2023
ORDER by week ASC

/*sqlite3 query available weeks for FantasyPros Tightend (TE) position*/
SELECT DISTINCT week
FROM fantasy_pros_TE
WHERE season LIKE = 2023
ORDER by week ASC

/*sqlite3 query available weeks for FantasyPros Widereceiver (WR) position*/
SELECT DISTINCT week
FROM fantasy_pros_WR
WHERE season LIKE = 2023
ORDER by week ASC

4. Match playerStatistics week to the corresponding week in FantasyPros tables.
/*sqlite3 query to combine available weeks for playerStatistics and FantasyPros tables*/
SELECT week, 'playerStatistics' as source
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT week
    FROM playerStatistics
    WHERE weekStart LIKE('%2023%')
) as ps

UNION ALL

SELECT week, 'fantasy_pros_WR' as source
